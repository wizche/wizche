I was very impressed on how fast and clean I had developed the UI in XAML and how all the bindings just worked.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">The more interesting part was the development of the platform-dependent services for the app to access native audio API and the Ads rendering (using <a href="https://www.google.com/admob/">AdMob </a>component).</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Fortunately some good guy already deployed a NuGet library called <a href="https://github.com/kphillpotts/Xamarin.Plugins">Lamp</a> to access camera flash across multiple platforms. I just had to pull the library source code to <a href="https://github.com/kphillpotts/Xamarin.Plugins/issues/3">fix a bug</a> within the Android implementation that prevented the flash to turn off.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">The Audio service is used to play different sound effects simultaneously which were synchronize against the thunder effects generated by the camera flash. I simply used <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/application_fundamentals/working_with_audio/">MediaPlayer</a> for Android and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AVFoundation/Reference/AVAudioPlayerClassReference/index.html">AvAudioPlayer</a> for iOS.&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">The challenging part was showing the interstitial Ad to the user before a sequence is started.&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr">I could not find ready to use library which supported Interstitial Ad from AdMob, nevertheless the <a href="https://github.com/sharker86/AdsPCLXamarin">AdsPCLXamarin</a> put me on the right track on how to develop a custom renderer for each platform for this purpose. It took sometime to get everything working in iOS once it was okay for Android, mostly because I had to migrate the project to unified API and fix some library compatibility issue.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">But, summing up, <u>20 hours later</u> I have a ad-supported app on both Google with a sleek UI and which, hopefully, is also useful!</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p6BJbJ_v9P0/VMZ_-6R9t9I/AAAAAAAABwU/KCmUe9s1d80/s1600/thunderlight.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p6BJbJ_v9P0/VMZ_-6R9t9I/AAAAAAAABwU/KCmUe9s1d80/s1600/thunderlight.gif" width="320" /></a></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Now, enough about the pro, here some cons I experienced:<br /><ul><li>Don't expect that working code on Android behave exactly the same on iOS</li><li>Label color on iOS was not working (TextColor property)</li><li>Debugging via a separate Mac with the Xamarin.iOS Build Host is a pain in the ass, Visual Studio was laggy and crashed <b>many</b>&nbsp;times (FYI: I have a dedicated LAN cable to the Mac)</li></ul></div><div dir="ltr"><br />I would like to thank all the community which is bringing day after day more and more ready to use libraries to <a href="http://xamarin.com/forms">Xamarin.Forms</a>.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><b>Google Play URL:</b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksonsoftware.android.thunderlight">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksonsoftware.android.thunderlight</a></div><div dir="ltr"><br /><b>AppStore URL:</b> <i>coming at somepoint</i></div>
